pace/domain.py
======================
Navigation domain schema: symbolic constants (enums) and the factory function
that constructs the OWL-style ontology used throughout the framework.

Why separate schema from the engine (ontology.py)?
  ontology.py is a generic, domain-agnostic engine.  domain.py is the
  application-specific vocabulary.  This separation means you can swap in a
  different domain (manufacturing, outdoor terrain, ...) without touching the
  core engine.

Adding properties to this schema does NOT automatically make them usable by the
affordance engine.  You must also add matching AffordanceRules in affordance.py
and (optionally) matching counterfactual-change logic in counterfactual.py.

    Ecological affordances relevant to robot navigation (Gibson, 1979).

    Each value represents one type of action possibility that a space may
    (or may not) offer to a given robot.  Affordances are not stored on
    individuals - they are *inferred* by the AffordanceReasoner from raw
    ontology properties.

    TRAVERSABLE  - Robot is permitted to enter and move through the space.
                   Blocked by: hazards, restricted areas, inaccessibility.
    PASSABLE     - Robot's body (width + clearance) fits within the space.
                   Blocked by: corridors narrower than robot + 2×clearance,
                               ceilings lower than robot height.
    CLIMBABLE    - The slope angle is within what the robot's drive system
                   can handle.  Blocked by slopes > max_slope_angle.
    OPENABLE     - The robot can open a closed (but not locked) door.
                   Only relevant for spaces that explicitly have a door.
    OBSERVABLE   - Space is well-lit enough for reliable sensor readings.
                   Blocked by illumination ≤ 0.25 (25% of maximum).
    AVOIDABLE    - This space can be excluded from the navigation plan.

      A ramp can exist indoors (accessible ramp beside stairs) or outdoors
